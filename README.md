<h2>hapily</h2>

hapily is a directory of APIs. On the index page, users can view APIs and sort by category. Creating an account allows users to add an API to the directory, upvote their favorites, and view favorites on a profile page. User profiles are public, so anyone can see APIs favorited by another user. Styling was done using jQuery masonry. View hapily here: http://hapily.herokuapp.com/
